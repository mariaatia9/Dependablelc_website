Salam Amer - Keefak?

I wanted to lay out below the issues that I think arise from the
actions/omissions of the other partners in Labby's.

1. First and foremost, Shayma contends that the signature on the partner's
minutes of meeting dated 10/1/2019 is not her signature.  This means we
have a criminal issue along with a civil claim.

2. For the partner's minutes of 22/7/2019 where Shayma did not attend/sign,
is there any record of notice being provided?

3.  The Articles are a bit ambiguous with respect to the Company's
obligation to share audited accounts with its shareholders.  Article 74
states that the books of account be kept at the registered office.  Article
75 then says that the "directors *may* be required by a resolution of
shareholders to cause to be made out and lay before the Company in a
meeting of shareholders at some date not later than eighteen months after
incorporation of the Company and subsequently once at least every calendar
year a profit and loss account for a period ...."  The problem here is that
it is not mandatory.  A shareholder resolution would need to be passed to
render such accounts mandatory.  We would need to look at the Companies Law
of DMCC to see if there is an obligation under the law.

4.  Articles 78 states that "the Company *shall* have one or more auditors
to be appointed by the shareholders."  I believe this has not happened, so
Shayma has recourse under this breach.

5.  Shayma is in possession of a check against the amount of the loan.
Though a portion of the loan has been paid off, I believe she should still
try to cash the check and let Mrs. Evanthia Vouraki deal with the
consequences as Shayma seeks to offload the burdens that this and other
liabilities generated by Ms. Vouraki have caused her.

6.  The FGB Irrevocable Guarantee provided by Shayman to Labby's is
concerning.  What is the amount and is there any record of Labby's and/or
Ms. Vouraki stating that they will indemnify Shayma for this liability?

Let's discuss the matter when you have a chance.

Thank you

Ali
