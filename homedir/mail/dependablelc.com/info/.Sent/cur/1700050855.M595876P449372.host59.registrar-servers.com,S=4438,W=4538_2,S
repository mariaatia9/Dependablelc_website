Dear Dana
According to your issue, as you told me in your email, I would like to
advise you with the following:
1-	If you want to go for a conflict with the company to claim your
commission of 60% for you and /40% for the company, you must have a prove
for that agreement, 
The proof must be written (agreement, Emails, clear WhatsApp message ..),
and do not depend on any previous transactions or payments you received
before from the company as per your agreement with them 60% /40%, because
this will not be strong proof.
2-	In any conflict between you and the company neither of you do not
have that strong proof, the company does not have it too.
So, if any conflict arises between you and the company regarding this
issue, you have to know that neither of you do not have the proof.
There is a risk in your claim if you want to go to court unless you have
that proof.



Best Regards.

Subject: Dana Sen/ Real Estate Case

Dear Aamer, 

Good morning! As discussed yesterday over the phone here is my case that I
have to sort out.

Since September 2021 I work for real estate company called Metropolitan
Premium Properties as a read estate agent. Once I joined the company I
have signed a Job offer letter stating that there is no fixed salary and
its commission based job. Its clearly written in the offer that that if we
close the deal with a company lead I share commission 50/50 with my
company. If I close my own personal lead its 60/40 in %.
1,5 years ago I closed one deal with the company lead, we shared
commission 50/50 as per the rule. 
After that the same client advised me to his friend, then this friends
advised me to another friend and so on. There were many clients who bought
properties from me like this. I after closing those deals I reported them
to my company as personal leads. Their admins asked me to share with them
whats app communications with the clients as a proof. I shared all
everything they wanted, all the information was transparent from my side.
They approved it as personal leads and commission was paid 60% mine and
40% for the company. 
But now after 1,5 years they told me that the calculation was wrong as any
lead who comes from a company lead is considered as a company client. Even
if my client doesnt even know the original company lead the person is
considered as a company lead and commission should be shared 50% /50%. I
didnt know about this rule and I have never signed any document from the
company explaining what do they mean by company lead. 
My manager told me that definitely there was a document with this
information and was signed by me as an acknowledgment. I asked them to
show me this document if it exist. They tried to find it, requested it
from HR, but apparently there were no any document. I have also asked them
why in this case there have been approving all my leads as my personal
leads even after I was providing all the information? They said that maybe
it was mistake from admin. 
As a result now they stopped all my commissions (apx 200k ), they are in
the process of recalculating all my previous deals snd they want to get
that 10% different from each deal that they consider as a company lead. I
consider it absolutely unfair and mo one even told me that this is rule
for company leads. 
At the same time there are also another agent in the company who didnt
know about this rule.

Please advise if there is a good chance to get pending commissions  from
them and not pay that 10% for each deal?

Thanks and regards
Dana
