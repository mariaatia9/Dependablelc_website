Dear Dana
That is good if you have emails from them approving the 60%/ 40%.

So, you can argue with them as you have these emails.

In case they do not accept to settle the issue with you as 60%/40% you do 
not have any other option but to make a labor case against them claiming the 
full amount


Best Regards.

Dear Aamer,

Thanks for your email.

The proof here is that their documents controller department approved for me 
the commission 60/40 and they agreed that its my personal client. I have 
written proof from them via email and whats app as well.
They are the ones who paid me my 60% commission but not they say that they 
made a mistake and they consider this client to be a company lead. So for 
all those deals they want me to pay them back 10%.

Basically there are apx 25 deals closed as 60/40. They approved that all 
those people are my clients. But now they say that it was a mistake and they 
considered them company clients and calculation should be 50/50. For all 
those deals they want me to give them 10% difference back. And as long as I 
have pending commissions, they blocked it and want to deduct the amount from 
pending money.

That time before paying me 60% they clearly approved is as my client, I have 
all the written confirmations.

Thanks and regards
Dana
