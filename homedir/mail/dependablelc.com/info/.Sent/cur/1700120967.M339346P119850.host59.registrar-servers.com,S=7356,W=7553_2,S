Dear Aamer,

We have these communications via whats app.
And they dont deny the fact that they confirmed and paid 60/40 before, but 
now that said that it has to be recalculated as 50/50 and they want to get 
they money back.
Im ok with opening the case, cause as I understand there is no other way to 
get money from them.
Please advise what are the chances of winning this case and what will be 
your charges here??

Thanks and Regards
Dana

>>
>> Dear Aamer,
>>
>> Good morning! As discussed yesterday over the phone here is my case
>> that I have to sort out.
>>
>> Since September 2021 I work for real estate company called
>> Metropolitan Premium Properties as a read estate agent. Once I joined
>> the company I have signed a Job offer letter stating that there is no
>> fixed salary and its commission based job. Its clearly written in the
>> offer that that if we close the deal with a company lead I share
>> commission 50/50 with my company. If I close my own personal lead its 
>> 60/40 in %.
>> 1,5 years ago I closed one deal with the company lead, we shared
>> commission
>> 50/50 as per the rule.
>> After that the same client advised me to his friend, then this
>> friends advised me to another friend and so on. There were many
>> clients who bought properties from me like this. I after closing
>> those deals I reported them to my company as personal leads. Their
>> admins asked me to share with them whats app communications with the
>> clients as a proof. I shared all everything they wanted, all the
>> information was transparent from my side. They approved it as personal 
>> leads and commission was paid 60% mine and 40% for the company.
>> But now after 1,5 years they told me that the calculation was wrong
>> as any lead who comes from a company lead is considered as a company
>> client. Even if my client doesnt even know the original company lead
>> the person is considered as a company lead and commission should be
>> shared 50% /50%. I didnt know about this rule and I have never signed
>> any document from the company explaining what do they mean by company 
>> lead.
>> My manager told me that definitely there was a document with this
>> information and was signed by me as an acknowledgment. I asked them
>> to show me this document if it exist. They tried to find it,
>> requested it from HR, but apparently there were no any document. I
>> have also asked them why in this case there have been approving all
>> my leads as my personal leads even after I was providing all the
>> information? They said that maybe it was mistake from admin.
>> As a result now they stopped all my commissions (apx 200k ), they are
>> in the process of recalculating all my previous deals snd they want
>> to get that 10% different from each deal that they consider as a
>> company lead. I consider it absolutely unfair and mo one even told me
>> that this is rule for company leads.
>> At the same time there are also another agent in the company who
>> didnt know about this rule.
>>
>> Please advise if there is a good chance to get pending commissions
>> from them and not pay that 10% for each deal?
